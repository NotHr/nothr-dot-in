I have't realized that it's been two good years of using linux as full fleged OS.
I have distro-hopped between Arch, Debian and Fedora, but Arch feel like home.
To be honest I hate redhat products(I don't excatly know why) and Debian is the good old distro which is stuck in 2022 or 2023.
And Arch is balzingliy fast and I like its package manager which is too good and thanks to [albony mirror](https://mirror.albony.in) for hyd node.

## The Arch Experince

Arch has been my daily driver since the last two years. I have been using `i3` because I don't need to touch the mouse again. I have switched to `KDE` for a while but now I am daily driving `i3`. And I have been using  `alacritty` with `zsh` but now moving to `fish`. 

I have also been using `zed` for a really long time as my editor which perfroms better than VS Code.
